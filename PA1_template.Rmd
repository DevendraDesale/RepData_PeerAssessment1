## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
summary(activity)
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

* Load the libraries.
```{r}
library(stats)
```

* Create a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.

```{r}
steps.date <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activity, FUN=sum)
barplot(steps.date$steps, names.arg=steps.date$date, xlab="date", ylab="steps")
```

* Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of
   steps taken per day.

```{r}
mean(steps.date$steps)
median(steps.date$steps)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
